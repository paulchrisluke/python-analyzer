# Authentication States Security Remediation

## Overview

This document outlines the security remediation performed on authentication state files that contained sensitive session tokens and PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

## Security Issues Identified

The following files contained live session tokens and sensitive user data:

- `auth-states/admin-state.json` - Contained admin session token and email `admin@cranberryhearing.com`
- `auth-states/buyer-state.json` - Contained buyer session token and test email
- `auth-states/viewer-state.json` - Contained viewer session token and test email
- `tests/auth-states/admin-state.json` - Duplicate admin state with different token
- `tests/auth-states/buyer-state.json` - Duplicate buyer state with different token  
- `tests/auth-states/viewer-state.json` - Duplicate viewer state with different token

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Sensitive Files
- Deleted all authentication state files from both `auth-states/` and `tests/auth-states/` directories
- These files contained live session tokens that could be used to impersonate users

### 2. Updated .gitignore
- Added `auth-states/` and `tests/auth-states/` to `.gitignore`
- This prevents future accidental commits of sensitive authentication data

### 3. Implemented Runtime Authentication
- The existing `tests/auth.setup.ts` already implements proper runtime authentication
- Authentication states are now generated dynamically using environment variables
- No sensitive data is stored in version control

### 4. Created Directory Structure
- Added `.gitkeep` file to `tests/auth-states/` to ensure directory exists
- Directory will be populated at runtime with generated authentication states

## Required Actions for Token Rotation

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Invalidate Exposed Session Tokens**
   The following session tokens were exposed and must be invalidated:
   
   **Admin Token**: `[REDACTED_TOKEN]`
   **Buyer Token**: `[REDACTED_TOKEN]`
   **Viewer Token**: `[REDACTED_TOKEN]`
   
   **Additional Admin Token**: `[REDACTED_TOKEN]`

2. **Rotate Admin Credentials**
   - Change password for `admin@cranberryhearing.com`
   - Consider rotating the admin email if possible
   - Update any CI/CD systems with new credentials

3. **Audit Access Logs**
   - Review authentication logs for any unauthorized access
   - Check for any suspicious activity using the exposed tokens

### Better Auth Token Invalidation

If using Better Auth, you can invalidate sessions by:

1. **Database Method**: Delete session records from the sessions table
2. **API Method**: Use Better Auth's session management endpoints
3. **User Method**: Force password reset for affected users

## Current Authentication Architecture

### Environment Variables Required

The system now uses environment variables for authentication:

```bash
# Admin user credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
ADMIN_NAME=System Administrator

# Buyer user credentials  
BUYER_EMAIL=buyer@yourdomain.com
BUYER_PASSWORD=your-secure-buyer-password
BUYER_NAME=Sarah Buyer

# Viewer user credentials
VIEWER_EMAIL=viewer@yourdomain.com
VIEWER_PASSWORD=your-secure-viewer-password
VIEWER_NAME=Mike Viewer
```

### Runtime Authentication Flow

1. **Setup Phase**: `tests/auth.setup.ts` runs before other tests
2. **Authentication**: Each role authenticates using environment variables
3. **State Generation**: Authentication state is saved to `tests/auth-states/`
4. **Test Execution**: Tests load the appropriate authentication state
5. **Cleanup**: Authentication states are regenerated on each test run

## Security Best Practices

### For Development
- Never commit authentication state files
- Use test-specific credentials, not production accounts
- Regularly rotate test user passwords
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

### For CI/CD
- Store credentials in secure secret management systems
- Use separate test databases
- Implement proper secret rotation policies
- Monitor for credential exposure in logs

### For Production
- Implement session token rotation
- Use secure session storage (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Monitor for suspicious authentication patterns
- Implement proper session timeout policies

## File Structure

```
website/
├── .gitignore                    # Updated to ignore auth-states
├── tests/
│   ├── auth.setup.ts            # Runtime authentication setup
│   ├── auth-states/             # Generated at runtime (git-ignored)
│   │   └── .gitkeep            # Ensures directory exists
│   └── [test files]            # Use generated auth states
└── SECURITY_AUTH_STATES.md     # This documentation
```

## Testing

To verify the new authentication system:

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Create `.env` file with test credentials
2. **Run Setup**: `npx playwright test --project=setup`
3. **Verify States**: Check that `tests/auth-states/` contains generated files
4. **Run Tests**: `npx playwright test` to ensure all tests pass

## Monitoring

- Monitor git commits for any authentication state files
- Set up alerts for sensitive data exposure
- Regular security audits of authentication flows
- Review and rotate credentials periodically
