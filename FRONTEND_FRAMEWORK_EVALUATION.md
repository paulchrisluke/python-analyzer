# Frontend Framework Evaluation & Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the current project structure and evaluating modern frontend frameworks, **Next.js 15 with App Router** is the recommended solution for the Cranberry Hearing & Balance Center sales website.

## Current Project Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure ✅
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Cloudflare Workers
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with SQLite (D1)
- **Document Management**: Comprehensive due diligence system
- **Data Structure**: Stage-based document filtering (public, nda, buyer, closing, internal)
- **Categories**: Financials, Equipment, Legal, Corporate, Other

### Current Limitations
- Basic HTML/CSS frontend with inline JavaScript
- No proper component architecture
- Limited admin panel functionality
- No real-time document status updates
- Manual document organization

## Framework Recommendation: Next.js 15

### Why Next.js 15?

#### 1. **Perfect Stack Integration**
- **Better Auth**: Native server-side authentication support
- **Cloudflare**: Excellent deployment to Cloudflare Pages + Workers
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support (current codebase is TS)
- **API Routes**: Can integrate with existing Worker logic

#### 2. **Document Management Excellence**
- **Server Components**: Secure document rendering without client-side exposure
- **File-based routing**: Natural organization for document categories
- **Middleware**: Built-in authentication and authorization
- **Static generation**: Fast loading for public documents
- **Dynamic imports**: Lazy loading for large documents

#### 3. **Admin Panel Capabilities**
- **Shadcn/ui components**: Beautiful, accessible admin panel components
- **Real-time updates**: Server-sent events for document status
- **Role-based access**: Easy integration with existing auth system
- **Dashboard components**: Charts, tables, forms with Shadcn/ui

#### 4. **Performance & SEO**
- **App Router**: Latest Next.js routing with improved performance
- **Server Components**: Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- **Image optimization**: Built-in image optimization
- **SEO**: Excellent SEO capabilities for public pages

## Alternative Frameworks Considered

### 1. **Vue.js 3 + Nuxt 3**
- **Pros**: Simpler learning curve, excellent composition API
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem for admin panels, less Cloudflare integration
- **Verdict**: Good alternative but Next.js ecosystem is stronger

### 2. **SvelteKit**
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, small bundle sizes
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, limited admin panel options
- **Verdict**: Great for simple sites, but admin panels need more ecosystem support

### 3. **React + Vite**
- **Pros**: Fast development, good performance
- **Cons**: Requires additional setup for SSR, routing, etc.
- **Verdict**: More setup work compared to Next.js
